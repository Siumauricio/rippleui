How to install Ripple UI in your project

## Setup

You can install RippleUI using npm, yarn or CDN.

1. To install RippleUI plugin is required to have [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) installed on your machine.

```bash disableTabs={true}
npm install rippleui
```

2. Add plugin to your `tailwind.config.js` file

```js disableTabs={true}
module.exports = {
  // ... the rest of your config
  plugins: [require("rippleui")],
};
```

3. CDN

If you prefer to use CDN, you can add the following link to your HTML file, but consider you can't remove the unused styles.

<CDN/>

```html
<button className="btn btn-primary">Hello World!</button>
```
